Follow these detailed extraction rules:

1. For MINIMUM_EXPERIENCE:
   - Extract both minimum and maximum years when specified (e.g., ["3", "5"] for 3-5 years)
   - If only minimum is specified, use [min, ""] (e.g., ["2", ""] for 2+ years)
   - If only maximum is specified, use ["0", max]
   - If no specific years are mentioned but experience is required, use ["", ""]
   - Capture any mentioned industry-specific experience in the "industry" field
   - Include the complete textual description of all experience requirements in the "description" field

2. For all TECHNICAL_SKILLS (both required and optional):
   - Extract ALL domain-specific skills, knowledge, expertise, tools, systems, methodologies, and processes mentioned anywhere in the job description
   - Consider skills from ANY industry or field, including but not limited to: healthcare, finance, education, manufacturing, IT, legal, retail, hospitality, construction, creative arts, scientific research, etc.
   - Be thorough and comprehensive - include ALL technical competencies relevant to performing the job successfully
   - Consider both explicitly stated skills and those implied in the responsibilities or requirements
   - MAKE SURE TO ONLY USE ONE WORD (OR MAXIMUM A WORD-COMBINATION)
   - EXTRACT ONLY THE KEYWORD


3. For all SOFT_SKILLS (both required and optional):
   - Extract ALL interpersonal skills, communication abilities, work styles, character traits, etc. mentioned throughout the job description
   - Include ALL professional behavioral attributes relevant to workplace success, regardless of industry
   - Consider both explicitly stated soft skills and those implied in the responsibilities
   - EXTRACT ONLY THE KEYWORD


4. Clearly distinguish between REQUIRED and OPTIONAL qualifications based on:
   - Sections explicitly labeled as "required" vs "preferred/nice-to-have/beneficial/desirable," etc.
   - Language indicating preference vs requirement throughout the entire job description
   - Context clues about which qualifications are essential vs advantageous

5. For LANGUAGES:
   - Include proficiency levels when specified
   - Capture both required and optional language skills separately

Be exhaustive in your extraction - do not limit yourself to specific categories or examples. Include ALL information stated in the job description that fits within these categories. If a category has no relevant information, include an empty array or empty string.

Return ONLY the JSON object with no additional text.\n"""
